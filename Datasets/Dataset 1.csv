i unlock bl, run twrp via cmd..no problem there.
then i format data to make clean flash.

go to: data/data/com.google.android.inputmethod.latin/shared_prefs/flag_value.xml
search for: ""enable_fast_access_bar""

Force close Gboard and give it some time to apply. This only works on some Facebook apps including WhatsApp and Google Messages.

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Saitama

10613,2020-08-13,22:55:12,"What is OSS Vendor?

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Saitama

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Saitama

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Rose

13078,2020-09-21,17:41:59,"What is OSS Vendor?

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Rose

13954,2020-10-06,14:08:45,"What is OSS Vendor?

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Rose

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Rose

14871,2020-11-05,10:12:08,"What is OSS Vendor?

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Rose

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Rose

17371,2020-12-29,21:06:03,"What is OSS Vendor?

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Rose

For china mi9t pro flash cn vendor of Rapheal  
 For global mi9t user flash Global vendor 
For eea device flash eea vendor

17848,2021-01-09,06:56:13,"What is OSS Vendor?

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Rose

19208,2021-02-07,23:35:21,"What is OSS Vendor?

● So our device has 5 variants.
● Xiaomi firmware website has all 5 official (firmware+vendor) zip files.
""Always flash your variants vendor.""

""Xiaomi never showed us what's in them. Aka closed source""

● Therefore, some devs decided to make a universal vendor that will work on all variants. Since they are making it. They can optimize it and also always know what's in it.
● This universal vendor is called OSS vendor. (Open Source Software) (It's not yet perfect though)

● Some custom ROMs don't include vendor (cause OSS isn't perfect yet)
● Some custom ROMs include OSS vendor (so we can observe how good it is in daily use)

● It's always good to know if the rom is using OSS or if we have to flash the official.
● Currently. Since OSS isn't perfect yet. If the rom doesn't include vendor (or it's a custom miui) do not flash/use OSS with it.",Rose

23362,2021-07-10,14:30:55,"Steps to get that madafaking L1 bacc (permanently lost) on AOSP roms with updated latest A11 meme blobs, like SPARK OS :-

Disclaimer - Do it only if you have access to a PC

1. Flash EU or IN meme which supports downloading L1 certificate. 
Fingerprint - Fingerprint payments -L1

2. Check Drm info

3. Boot to recovery

4. Wipe System, data, cache 
    DON'T WIPE VENDOR 

Fastboot stuck issue ? Yea but don't worry about it right now

5. Flash Spark Os - DFE (if decrypted) - L1 patch 

6. Reboot

It'll reboot just fine, set it up like usual, check drm info, L1 will still be there (naacho Bkl)

But but but... Now when you'll try to reboot to recovery it'll go straight to Fastboot and the rom won't boot anywhere, just stuck on fastboot, so.... What now?

1. Get the latest OFOX recovery.img 

2. Now if you want to access recovery, you'll need to boot directly to it 
With command

fastboot boot recovery.img

And you can access temporary recovery when you need it, i need it for only magisk and migrate so no further use of recovery, i can just boot to recovery when I want, 
So until the recovery issue is fixed this is the workaround.

Normal reboot and shutdown has no issues, it'll be like having a stock rom with no recovery but L1, and you have access to recovery only when you need it.",K20 Pro / Mi9T pro Mods [ EOL ]

24459,2021-10-25,15:36:06,"Lawnchair 12 Alpha 1 is here! Based on Launcher3 from Android 12, this release has an all-new look and all the features of Lawnchair 11, with a couple of additions. Some highlights:

• The App Drawer, folders, pop-ups, and everything in between have the new look from Android 12.
• Lawnchair can extract the dominant color from your wallpaper and use it throughout the UI, tinting buttons, backgrounds, and the like. This works on Android 8.1 and later.
• Touch and hold an app icon to change its label or hide it from the App Drawer.
• When searching in the App Drawer, tap Enter to open the first result. You can also set the keyboard to open automatically with the App Drawer.

Other changes include a new editor for the Home Screen grid, a refined accent color selector, and an experimental Font setting. Lawnchair 12 works on Android 8 to 12 and integrates with QuickSwitch on Android 11 and 12. We hope you enjoy it!",K20 Pro / Mi9T pro Mods [ EOL ]
